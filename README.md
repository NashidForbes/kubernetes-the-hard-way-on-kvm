# Kubernetes The Hard Way on KVM

This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way. This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a Kubernetes cluster. If that's you then check out [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), or the [Getting Started Guides](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.

> The results of this tutorial should not be viewed as production ready, and may receive limited support from the community, but don't let that stop you from learning!


## Major Changes from Original Kubernetes the Hard Way

* Instead of GCP, KVM is used.
* HA Proxy is used as a load balancer for API Server.
* KVM host is in charge of Pod Network Routes.
* Cloud Shell in GCP is replaced by a virtual machine.
* Nodes' name and IP address starts from `1` (Note that the name of etcd nodes starts from `etcd-0`).
* The order of chapters are a little bit changed.
* The version of Ubuntu is xenial.
* (Todo) Additional information is added for CKA Exam.


## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is someone planning to support a production Kubernetes cluster and wants to understand how everything fits together.

Also this tutorial assumes that the audience have some experiences of KVM (i.e. creating and deleting VMs).


## Cluster Details

Kubernetes The Hard Way guides you through bootstrapping a highly available Kubernetes cluster with end-to-end encryption between components and RBAC authentication.
